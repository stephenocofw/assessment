# Incident Timeline & Systemic Factor Mapping

This document outlines the relationship between **Timeline Event Types** and **Systemic Factors**. It serves as a guide for investigators to move from *what happened* (Timeline) to *why it made sense* (Systemic Assessment).

---

## 1. Planning & Preparation
**Focus:** Steps taken before work began—assignments, risk assessments, permits, and tool selection.
**Key Question:** *Was the work set up for success, or were there latent conditions present before start-up?*

### Recommended Systemic Factors:
*   **Operational Management (Enable):** Look for issues in scheduling, supervision ratios, or task assignment.
*   **Risk Management (Guide):** Did the JHA/Risk Assessment catch the actual risks? Was it too generic?
*   **Resource Allocation (Enable):** Were the right tools, people, and time allocated during the planning phase?
*   **Work Understanding (Guide):** Did the plan reflect "Work-as-Imagined" vs "Work-as-Done"?

---

## 2. Conditions & Context
**Focus:** The environment and state of the system—weather, lighting, fatigue, staffing levels, pressure.
**Key Question:** *How did the conditions influence human performance and equipment reliability?*

### Recommended Systemic Factors:
*   **Resource Allocation (Enable):** Staffing shortages, budget constraints affecting maintenance.
*   **Goal Conflict & Trade-offs (Enable):** Was there pressure to continue despite poor conditions (e.g., "production over safety")?
*   **Strategy (Guide):** Do strategic KPI targets inadvertently encourage working in poor conditions?

---

## 3. Normal Work
**Focus:** Routine execution of tasks as they are normally done (not just as written in procedure).
**Key Question:** *Why did this moment look like "normal business" right up until it didn't?*

### Recommended Systemic Factors:
*   **Work Understanding (Guide):** This is the #1 factor. Does leadership know how work is actually performed?
*   **Frontline Workers (Execute):** How do workers adapt to get the job done daily?
*   **Management Systems (Enable):** Are the procedures usable, or do workers have to bypass them to work "normally"?

---

## 4. System Controls & Barriers
**Focus:** Physical or administrative controls—guards, interlocks, soft barriers, permits, checks.
**Key Question:** *Why were controls missing, failed, or bypassed?*

### Recommended Systemic Factors:
*   **Management Systems (Enable):** Design and maintenance of the controls themselves.
*   **Safety Organisation (Guide):** Effectiveness of the safety governance in verifying controls.
*   **Design for Safety (Enable/Guide):** (If applicable) Was the hazard engineered out?

---

## 5. Interactions & Interfaces
**Focus:** Where systems meet—human-machine, team-to-team, contractor-client, workgroup-workgroup.
**Key Question:** *Did a breakdown in coordination or handoff create the risk?*

### Recommended Systemic Factors:
*   **Communication & Coordination (Execute):** Handovers, radio comms, shared mental models.
*   **Contractor Management (Execute):** Alignment between site standards and contractor practices.
*   **Operational Management (Enable):** Coordination between different workgroups (e.g., Maintenance vs Operations).

---

## 6. Deviation / Drift
**Focus:** The moment the situation changed—unexpected equipment behavior, slip/lapse, or procedural drift.
**Key Question:** *What influenced the drift or the unexpected response?*

### Recommended Systemic Factors:
*   **Monitoring & Metrics (Execute):** Did we have signals that drift was occurring before the incident?
*   **Learning & Development (Enable):** Did the person have the skills to recognise the deviation?
*   **Decision Making (Execute):** How were decisions made once the drift was noticed?

---

## 7. Recovery & Adaptation
**Focus:** Actions taken to save the day—successful interventions, near misses, stopping work.
**Key Question:** *What went **right**? How did the system survive or minimise harm?*

### Recommended Systemic Factors:
*   **Frontline Workers (Execute):** Agency and expertise of the worker to respond.
*   **Decision Making (Execute):** Rapid assessment and action under pressure.
*   **Learning & Development (Enable):** Was the recovery due to good training/drills?

---

## 8. Outcome
**Focus:** The actual impact—injury, damage, spill, near miss.
**Mapping:** This usually triggers the severity classification but drives the *urgency* of the investigation rather than specific systemic factors. However, the **Nature of the Outcome** can point to:
*   **Strategy (Guide):** If outcomes are consistently high-severity, is the organizational risk appetite too high?

---

## 9. Response & Stabilisation
**Focus:** Immediate post-incident actions—first aid, scene preservation, emergency response.
**Key Question:** *Was the emergency response effective?*

### Recommended Systemic Factors:
*   **Resource Allocation (Enable):** Emergency equipment availability.
*   **Communication & Coordination (Execute):** Efficiency of the emergency response team.

---

## 10. Learning & Follow-up
**Focus:** Reporting, investigation quality, and action closure.
**Key Question:** *Does the organisation actually learn, or just file reports?*

### Recommended Systemic Factors:
*   **Learning & Development (Enable):** Institutional memory.
*   **Senior Leadership (Guide):** How do leaders respond to bad news? (Psychological safety).
*   **Monitoring & Metrics (Execute):** Are findings actually tracked to closure?
